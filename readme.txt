UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CABINET APPOINTMENTS DATASET

A cabinet of US federal department executives has been a part of every US administration since George Washington. While a cabinet is not formally required by the US constitution, Article II, Section 2 effectively assumes it by authorizing the president to seek advice from the principal officer in each of the executive departments.  

This dataset consists of a series of csv files described below:

It includes data on name, service dates, notable scandals, education, military service, foreign birth, known minority and gender status, whether the appointee died in office, and the senate confirmation vote tallies.
